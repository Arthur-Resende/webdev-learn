## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Installing

To clone this repository, git is reccomended, [Download git.](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
Once git is installed, do the following:

```
# Clone this repository

Optionally, Python module http.server serves the root directory as a simple http server. [Download python.](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
Once Python is installed, do the following:
```
# Go to your project directory
cd <website-repository> # Make sure to replace <website-repository> with the path to the root directory of if this code

# Serve current repository
python3 -m http.server

# If the code above does not work, try this:

You should see an output similar to this:

```
$ python -m http.server
Serving HTTP on :: port 8000 (http://[::]:8000/) ...
