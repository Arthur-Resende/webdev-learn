        <h1>Hi there :)</h1>
        <h2>Welcome to my humble page, come on in!</h2>
        <p>
            This website was built to get some familiarity back with basic front-end tools, while learning GIT 
            best practices along the way. In order to get some practice (and to really nail my understanding 
            down) I'll write a bunch of artiles and publish them here as well.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hope this is as userful to you as is was for me. Once I'm done building this website, I'll study 
            other stuff, like angular development and production line best practices.
        </p>
        <p>
            Feel free to stay for as long as you want!
        </p>
