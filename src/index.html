                    <h2>What is the purpose of this place?</h2>

                    <p>
                        This website was built to get some familiarity back with basic front-end tools, while learning GIT 
                        best practices along the way. In order to get some practice (and to really nail my understanding 
                        down) I'll write a bunch of artiles and publish them here as well.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Hope this is as userful to you as is was for me. Once I'm done building this website, I'll study 
                        other stuff, like angular development and production line best practices.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>Feel free to stay for as long as you want!</p>
